Executive Summary

This document explains that a for loop is used to repeat actions when iterating over collections, ranges, or sequences where the number of iterations is known in advance. A while loop, on the other hand, repeats instructions as long as a logical condition remains true, making it the best choice when the number of repetitions is unknown.
A counter is used to keep track of how many repetitions have occurred, while an accumulator stores partial or final totals by adding values over time.
It is essential to define a clear exit condition to prevent infinite loops that could freeze the program or consume unnecessary resources.
This document will describe each problem, outline the input and output design, specify the necessary validations, and explain the proper use of for and while loops in iterations, menus, and repeated user inputs.

Principles and good Practices

Use the for loop when you know the number of iterations beforehand
(for example, looping from 1 to 10).

Use a while loop when repetition depends on a condition that may change
during execution (for example, reading input until the user types "EXIT").

Always initialize counters and accumulators before entering a loop
to avoid logical errors or unexpected values.

In while loops, make sure to update the control variable inside the loop
to prevent infinite cycles.

Keep the body of the loop simple and readable; if the logic becomes complex,
move parts of it into separate functions to improve clarity and maintainability.

Problem 1: Sum of range with for
Description:
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). 
Additionally, calculate the sum of only the even numbers 
within that same range using a for loop.

Inputs:
n_input = input("Enter n: ")
Outputs:
"Sum 1..n:", total_sum
"Even sum 1..n:", even_sum
Validations:
n < 1:("Error: invalid input")
Test cases:
1) Normal: 
Enter n: 15
Sum 1..n: 120
Even sum 1..n: 56
2) Border: 
Enter n: 1
Sum 1..n: 1
Even sum 1..n: 0

3) Error:

5 x 3 = 15
5 x 4 = 20

Inputs:
base = int
m = int

Outputs:
resultado = base * i

Problem 3: Average of numbers with while and sentinel
Description:
Read numbers one by one until the user enters a sentinel value (for example, -1). 
Calculate the average of the valid numbers entered and the total number of numbers read. 
If the user only enters the sentinel without any valid numbers, display an error message.

Problem 4: Password attempts with while
Description:
Implement a simple password attempt system. Define a valid password in the code (for example, "admin123"). 
The user has a maximum of MAX_ATTEMPTS attempts to enter it. If they enter it correctly within the limit, display a success message. 
If they run out of attempts, display a lock message.

Problem 5: Simple menu with while
Description:
Complement a text menu that repeats until the user selects the exit option. Example menu:
1) Show greeting

Problem 6: Pattern printing with nested loops

Description:
Use nested for loops to print a pattern of asterisks in the shape of a right triangle. 
For example, for n = 4:
*
**

(optional if you wish to extend this, but please document your decision).

"""
Conclusions

The for loop is useful when the number of repetitions is known in advance, while a while loop is better suited for situations where repetition depends on a changing condition.
Counters and accumulators help keep track of sums, attempts, or other values as a loop runs.
One of the main risks of using a while loop is accidentally creating an infinite loop if the condition is not updated correctly.
Menus and password-based systems are common examples where while loops work especially well.
Nested loops make it possible to create patterns—such as asterisks arranged in triangles—and help reinforce the idea of repetition occurring inside another repetition.
