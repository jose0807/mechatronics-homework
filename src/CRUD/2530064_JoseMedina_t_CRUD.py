Assignment: CRUD Project Bakery Inventory CRUD

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This program implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for a 
bakery inventory using Python functions. A nested dictionary structure is used 
to store each type of bread. Every key in the main dictionary represents a 
product identifier, and its value is another dictionary containing fields such 
as name, price, and remaining quantity.
The program includes:
- Creating new bread types
- Deleting existing bread types
- Updating price or quantity
- Listing all products
- Processing orders, reducing quantities, and calculating totals
The menu-driven interface allows users to interact dynamically with the 
inventory. Input validation functions prevent invalid numbers or empty fields 
from crashing the program. This CRUD demonstrates how in-memory data 
structures can be manipulated through well-defined functions.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
This program manages a bakery inventory containing various bread types. 
A nested dictionary (Option A) was chosen as the main structure:
products = {
    "mexican sweet bread": {
        "name": "mexican sweet bread",
        "price": 10.5,
        "quantity remaining": 20
    },
    ...
}
Reason for choosing nested dictionaries:
1) Fast lookup using product identifiers.
2) Allows grouping of product attributes in a readable way.
3) Easy to update individual fields inside each product.
4) Direct access without searching through lists.
INPUTS (AS USED IN YOUR CODE)
1. Menu option:
   - User enters by number or name: 
     "1", "new type of bread", "2", "delete type of bread", "3", etc.
2. For creating a bread type:
   - key (product identifier)
   - name (product name)
   - quantity (as string, later validated and converted to int)
   - price (as string, later validated and converted to float)
3. For deleting a bread type:
   - key (must match existing key exactly)
4. For updating:
   - key
   - price (can be empty → None)
   - quantity (can be empty → None)
5. For orders:
   - key (bread type)
   - quantity (int)
   - YES/NO confirmation-
OUTPUTS (AS PRODUCED BY YOUR CODE)-
- "your product X has been added under the key Y"
- "error: invalid input"
- "error:the key is not in the dictionary"
- "X deleted succesfully"
- "please set a valid price"
- "please set a valid quantity"
- "you cant have a negative value"
- "your quantity must not be less than 0"
- "currently we don't have X"
- "sorry we don't have enough X in inventory"
- Listing of all products with all fields printed
- Total cost after placing an order

REALISTIC TEST CASES (BASED ON YOUR PROGRAM BEHAVIOR)

TEST CASE 1 — NORMAL 
User selects: 1 (new type of bread)
Inputs:
  key = "banana bread"
  name = "banana bread"
  quantity = "15"
  price = "22"
Expected program behavior:
  - input_validation() converts price→22.0, quantity→15
  - adding_bread_type() adds the new dictionary entry
Program Output:
  "your product banana bread has been added under the key banana bread"
  Then listing() prints all products including the new one:
      product: banana bread
       name: banana bread
       price: 22.0
       quantity remaining: 15

TEST CASE 2 — BORDER CASE 
User selects: 3 
Inputs:
  key = "donut"
  price = ""     (empty → means do not update)
  quantity = "100"
Expected program behavior:
  - input_validation() returns price=None, quantity=100
  - updating_quantity_or_price() updates only "quantity remaining"
Program Output:
  (prints donut's updated fields)
   name donut
   price 8.5
   quantity remaining 100

TEST CASE 3 — ERROR CASE 
User selects: 1 (new type of bread)
Inputs:
  key = "badbread"
  name = "bad bread"
  quantity = "5"
  price = "abc"
Expected program behavior:
  - input_validation() detects price cannot convert to float
Program Output:
  "please set a valid price"
  Item is NOT added

CONCLUSIONS
The CRUD structure made the inventory system organized, separating creation, 
deletion, updating, and ordering into their own functions. This modularity 
improves clarity and reduces errors. Nested dictionaries worked efficiently 
because each bread type could be accessed instantly by its identifier and 
updated easily.
A significant challenge was input validation, especially when converting 
price and quantity from raw user input. The validation function helped 
prevent invalid conversions and improved program safety.
This CRUD can be extended to persistent storage by saving the dictionary 
into a JSON file or interacting with a database for long-term inventory 
management.
